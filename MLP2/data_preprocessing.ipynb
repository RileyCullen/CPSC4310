    "The purpose of this notebook is to perform data preprocessing on the two datasets located within the raw_data directory. This program will:\n",
    "1. Find the number of missing/NaN/null values\n",
    "2. Remove entry or impute missing values (depending on # of missing values)\n",
    "3. Convert all categorical features to numeric features (logistic regression, SVM, and neural network models require numeric features)\n",
    "4. Normalize all features to range [0, 1] (required for SVMs since they use distance as a metric; recommended for neural networks)\n",
